;;; Commentary:

;; Minor mode to sync org-mode buffer and trello board
;;
;; 1) Add the following to your emacs init file
;; (require 'org-trello)
;; (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'org-trello-mode)
;;
;; 2) Once - Install the consumer-key and the read-write token for org-trello to be able to work in your name with your trello boards (C-c o i)
;; M-x org-trello/install-key-and-token
;;
;; 3) Once per org-mode file/board you want to connect to (C-c o I)
;; M-x org-trello/install-board-and-lists-ids
;;
;; 4) You can also create a board directly from a org-mode buffer (C-c o b)
;; M-x org-trello/create-board
;;
;; 5) Check your setup (C-c o d)
;; M-x org-trello/check-setup
;;
;; 6) Help (C-c o h)
;; M-x org-trello/help-describing-setup
;;
;; Now you can work with trello from the comfort of emacs.
;; Enjoy!
